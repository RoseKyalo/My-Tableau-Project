## **Introduction**

Among the 17 global goals, one crucial aim is to ensure peace, justice, and strong institutions. This objective encompasses several specific targets, including:

1. **Target 16.1:** To significantly reduce all forms of violence and related death rates globally.

2. **Target 16.3:** To promote the rule of law at the national and international levels and ensure equal access to justice for all.

3. **Target 16.6:** To develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels.
**`Extrajudicial killings`**—those carried out without legal authority—fall under these targets. They represent a violation of the rule of law and justice and hinder efforts to reduce violence.

In Kenya, according to Missing voices a campaign group focused on extrajudicial killings,there has been 1,264 cases since 2017 when it started collecting the data.It is reported that only a handful of police officers have been convicted through investigations done by Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA).

In 2016, the case involving Willie Kimani, Josephat Mwenda, and their taxi driver, Joseph Muiruri, captured national attention. Josephat had filed a complaint with the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) after being shot by a police officer. Assigned to the case, Willie Kimani and his companions were later illegally detained and tragically found dead in a river in Machakos County. This incident represents the broader issue of extrajudicial killings in Kenya.

## **Objective**

This project aims to explore extrajudicial killings in Kenya sourced from the Missing Voices website.By analyzing this data, we seek to inform the development of policies aimed at curbing extrajudicial killings and promoting accountability within law enforcement agencies.

## **Problem Statement**
The consistent occurence of extrajudicial killings in Kenya represents violation of human rights and a pressing need for comprehensive policy reforms  to address the root causes of extrajudicial killings in Kenya, safeguard human rights, and ensure accountability and justice for victims and their families.

## **Data Source**
The data is sourced from Missing Voices website comprising 512 entries with the following attributes;            
1. Age: Age of the missing individual.
2. Name: Name of the missing individual.
3. Sex: Gender of the missing individual.
4. Location: Location where the individual went missing.
5. Date of Incident: Date when the individual went missing.
6. Manner of Death: Circumstances surrounding the individual's demise.

## **Tools**
Data cleaning and preparation were conducted using Tableau and Excel. These tools facilitated the organization and analysis of the dataset, enabling us to derive meaningful insights into the issue of extrajudicial killings in Kenya.

## Methodology
The dataset was obtained by scraping data from the Missing Voices website. Subsequently, the data was converted into an Excel file for further processing. To enhance the analysis in Tableau, I performed feature engineering on the county column, enabling precise identification of locations. Additionally, I addressed null values, particularly in the Name column, which were encoded as "unknown". These null values were filtered out using Tableau's filtering feature. The analysis was predominantly conducted using Tableau, leveraging its powerful visualization capabilities to derive insights from the data.

## **Findings**
`1. It is evident that extrajudicial killings are happening across the country with incidents reported in every county.This highlights the urgent need for policy changes and reforms across all counties to address this serious issue.`

`2. The predominant cause of death appears to be "Shot","Torture" and "Missing" with the highest frequency occurring among individuals aged 22. This suggests a concerning pattern of extrajudicial killings primarily affecting young people.`

`3. Nairobi County recorded the highest number of deaths, notably among males with a count of 210, whereas for females, the count was 4.`

`4. This gender disproportion is consistent across all counties, with males being the most affected. The peak age for extrajudicial killings is 22, indicating a significant impact on young males in particular.`

`5. In 2021, the highest number of deaths, totaling 192, was recorded. Notably, both February and May experienced peaks in extrajudicial killings, with September marking the lowest count. The significance of these patterns underscores the imperative for further research into the factors contributing to the elevated extrajudicial killings in 2021.`

## Recommendations

1. **Research on 2021 Spikes:** Conduct further research to understand the reasons behind the surge in extrajudicial killings during 2021.

2. **Gun Ownership Reforms:** Advocate for reforms to regulate gun ownership and usage, aiming to prevent unauthorized firearm use and reduce extrajudicial killings.

3. **Law Enforcement Overhaul:** Push for a comprehensive overhaul of law enforcement practices, focusing on training, protocols, and accountability mechanisms to ensure adherence to human rights standards and ethical conduct.
   
## Limitations

Insufficient data for limits the ability to fully analyze trends and patterns. More data collection is needed to overcome this limitation and gain a better understanding of the situation.
